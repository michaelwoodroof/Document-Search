# Document-Search
Python Command Line based program that searches a text file with a given query and returns relevant infomation.

In this program the DocSearch.py searches Docs.txt for all the unique words that feature in Docs.txt and then using Queries.txt it finds all the lines within Docs.txt that have this given query. From this an angle is calculated this angle is how closely realted the line is to the query being closer to 90 means a higher match.
